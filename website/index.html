        <h1>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h1>
        <p class="p-text">
            IT plays an integral role in every industry. It helps companies improve business processes, achieve cost
            efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Information
            technology can speed up the time it takes new products to reach the market. Companies rely on IT for fast
            communications, data processing and market intelligence.

        <h1>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h1>
        <p class="p-text" cl>
            In order to make a digital project successful we need following.
            A vision of the product, which comes from the sponsor of the project.
            A development, which will translate the vision of the sponsor to a software art-effect.
            A UX/ Design team, which will make sure the digital product is of high quality and easy to use.
            A QA team, which will make sure that digital products have all the functionality as per the vision of the
            product sponsor.
            Collaboration tools will help the digital team to communicate in a productive manner. Slack is a well
            adopted tool.

    <div id="three" class="center">
        <h1>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h1>
        <p class="p-text">Planning and the execution of the project will be done using the Agile methods. Task will be
            worked on in an
            Agile Sprints. To manage the Sprints tools like Trello will be used.

    <div id="four" class="center">
        <h1>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h1>
        <p class="p-text">One of the biggest risk or a digital project is the scope creep, which will lead the project
            to not finish
            on time. If the user feedback is not taken regularly during the development of digital product, we may end
            up with a product which doesn’t solve the given problem. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="five" class="center">
        <h1>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>
        <p class="p-text">Every digital project is different from the last one, hence you have to choose the tools
            according to the
            nature of the project. You should always consider choosing the tools which are widely adopted by the
            market.

    <div id="six" class="center">
        <h1>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h1>
        <p class="p-text">
            You need to choose the right technology for the task you are trying to solve. I have used Trello and Github
            and they have helped me many times.
            Trello lets you organise the work collaboratively.
            Github gives a platform for all the team members to access and alter the code.
            Slack is a communication tool, which help the team members to communcate with one another.

    <div id="seven" class="center">
        <h1>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h1>
        <p class="p-text">It is important to know that the internet has certain laws and regulations, which includes
            constraints on
            uploading and downloading, copyrights, licence, child protection.
            In 1995 GDPR came into legal force and it has far-reaching impacts on individuals and organisations in all
            sectors globally. The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and
            employees more power over their data and less power to the organisations that collect and use such data for
            monetary gain.One of the aim of GDPR was to protect individuals’ personal data.
